- Added a minor API fix. Close and assign request format changed from `api/v3/requests/<Request Id>/close` and `api/v3/requests/<Request Id>/assign` to `api/v3/requests/<Request Id>/_close` and `api/v3/requests/<Request Id>/_assign` respectively. 
- This change might break BC if not updating the pack as the previous format will be deprecated by November 15th 2020.
- Upgraded the Docker image to demistoq/python3:3.8.6.12176.
